# LinkIt

A fast-paced casual puzzle game built in Unity, focused on quick decision-making, clean input, and combo-based scoring.

## Overview
LinkIt is a single-player puzzle game where the player connects matching shapes on a grid to score points and build combos before time runs out. 
The challenge lies in making fast, accurate connections while maintaining combo chains for higher scores.

## Gameplay
The player draws lines to connect matching shapes on a grid.  
Longer connections and faster actions increase the score and also increases the time you have.
The game ends when the timer expires.

## Things I changed while making this game (extra)
- At first I thought of making just a connect game but later it became boring.
- So later I added combos to make it interesting.
- But unlike other connect games where game ends when you run out of moves here I though of making some changes and game ends when you run out of time.
- This added more pace to game later I decided that combo should have time too so that player is always encouraged to play faster and have less time to think.
- And for scoring system number of combo is just multiplied by number of tiles destroyed.
